# citizen-science-notebooks
A collection of Jupyter notebook that can be used to associate Rubin Science Platform data to a Zooniverse citizen science project.

These notebooks are intended to be used within the Rubin Science Platform Notebook Aspect for associating Rubin data with a Zooniverse citizen science project.

First, run the `01_Introduction_to_Citsci_Pipeline.ipynb` notebook; it guides a PI through the process of sending data from the Rubin Science Platform (RSP) to the Zooniverse and retrieving classifications from Zooniverse.

The `utils.py` script contains general plotting, butler, and manifest utilities. If necessary, it can be modified carefully.
