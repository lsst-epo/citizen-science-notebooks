# citizen-science-notebooks
A collection of Jupyter notebook that can be used to associate Rubin Science Platform data to a Zooniverse citizen science project.

These notebooks are intended to be used within the Rubin Science Platform Notebook Aspect for associating Rubin data with a Zooniverse citizen science project.

The Citizen_Science_Testing.ipynb is most relevant; it guides a PI through the process of sending data from the Rubin Science Platform (RSP) to the Zooniverse and retrieving classifications from Zooniverse.

The utils.py script contains general plotting, butler, and manifest utilities. If necessary, it can be modified carefully.

The rubin_citsci_core_pipeline.py script contains utilities related to the citizen science pipeline. Do not modify.

Additional notebooks are deprecated.
